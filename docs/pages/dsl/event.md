[EventActivator](https://github.com/just-ai/jaicf-kotlin/blob/master/core/src/main/kotlin/com/justai/jaicf/activator/event/EventActivator.kt) can be used in JAICF project to handle some events generated by channels that are not a result of user's speech or text request.

Some channels generate such events in cases like launching a voice skill (Alexa's "LAUNCH" event), audio player events ("PLAY", "STOP" and etc.) and some others.

# How to use

All you need to use event activator in your JAICF project is to add `event` activators to the scenarios and then append `BaseEventActivator` to the `BotEngine`'s array of activators.

## event activator

```kotlin
state("next") {
    activators {
        event(AlexaEvent.NEXT)
        intent(AlexaIntent.NEXT)
    }

    action {
        ...
    }   
}

state("pause") {
    activators {
        event(AlexaEvent.PAUSE)
        intent(AlexaIntent.PAUSE)
    }

    action {
        ...
    }
}
```

## EventActivator configuration

Event activator is built-in into every `BotEngine` by default and doesn't require any additional configuration.

Some channels provide its own implementation of [EventActivator](https://github.com/just-ai/jaicf-kotlin/blob/master/core/src/main/kotlin/com/justai/jaicf/activator/event/EventActivator.kt).
Thus if you create an **Alexa-only** agent, you may omit `BaseEventActivator` from the `activators` array:

```kotlin
val helloWorldBot = BotEngine(
    model = HelloWorldScenario.model,
    activators = arrayOf(
        AlexaActivator
    )
)
```

# Event name

Once a `EventActivator` activates some state, a [EventActivatorContext](https://github.com/just-ai/jaicf-kotlin/blob/master/core/src/main/kotlin/com/justai/jaicf/activator/event/EventActivatorContext.kt) instance becomes available through an `activator.evebt` variable in the action block of this state.
This object contains the name of the event that activated this state.
