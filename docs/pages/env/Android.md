JAICF is compatible with [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio) enabling you to run your dialogue scenarios right on the Android device instead of serving it in the cloud like [Heroku](Heroku).

This can be useful if your scenario doesn't require frequent updates.
In this case you're able to perform all conversational tasks right on the device or connect your embedded scenario to one of [supported NLU services](Natural-Language-Understanding).

# How to use

We provide [JAICF library](https://github.com/just-ai/aimybox-android-sdk/tree/master/jaicf-api) as a part of our open source [Aimybox SDK](https://github.com/just-ai/aimybox-android-assistant).

This SDK simplifies development of voice-enabled Android and iOS applications providing a comprehensive voice-centric architecture and wide range of ready-to use libraries for speech recognition, speech synthesis and NLU.

_To start using this library please read [documentation](https://github.com/just-ai/aimybox-android-sdk/tree/master/jaicf-api) and go through an [template project for Android](https://github.com/just-ai/jaicf-android-template)._
