## How to contribute to JAICF

There are a lot of ways on how you can contribute to JAICF 😀

#### 1. Add a new channel support

There is a list of already supported channels like Facebook Messenger, Amazon Alexa and others. 
But it doesn't mean that everything is done on this way! 
If you're finding some popular (or not) channel's lack, you're welcome to implement a new channel to make JAICF compatible with it. 
Please learn more about how to create a new channel implementation.

#### 2. Add a new NLU engine support

Every dialogue is driven by some NLU engines like Google Dialogflow or Rasa.
If there is any engine that is not supported by JAICF yet, it's a good time for you to create it's implementation right now!
